 # Magnet Link Fetcher
A few helpful files for people interested in looking at *pointless* magnet links.


# getMovies

This will retrive a list of movies recently released on DVD. It will then fetch the top 1080p magnet link.

Usage: 'python getMovies.py'

# getShows

Given a show and season, this will get the top magnet link for each episode. Handy when you want to get a season that has not yet finished but do not want to crawl through pb.

Usage: 'python getshows.py "[Show Name + other keywords]" [Season Number]
